## UI Components

The `/ui` folder houses all the user interface components. These components are responsible for the visual elements and interactions within our application. Feel free to explore and reuse these components to maintain a consistent and cohesive user interface throughout the project.

## Layout Components

In the `/layouts` folder, you will find components related to the overall layout and structure of our application. These components define the arrangement and positioning of UI elements on different pages. Adjust and combine these layout components to create the desired structure for various sections of your application.

## Section Components

The `/sections` folder contains components that represent larger sections or modules within our application. These components may combine UI and layout components to create self-contained and reusable sections of our project. Use these section components to build and organize the main content areas of your application.
